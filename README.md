# Professional Work Portfolio

## Description

This application wil generate a random password based on criteria users have selected. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. The page is designed with a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes. 

This project is to showcase what I have recently learned in class.

Page is reactive for phones when the max pixel width is at 580px.<br>
Page is reactive for tablets when the max pizel width is at 768px. 


## Page Setup
